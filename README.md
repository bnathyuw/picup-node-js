# Picup and node.js

iOS doesnâ€™t natively support file uploads, but there are various apps that do.

One of them is [Picup](http://picupapp.com/).

This project is a simple proof of concept for uploading files using Picup.

However, I thought I would use this as an excuse to use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), really just for added geekiness.
